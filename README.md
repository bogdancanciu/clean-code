# clean-code

This repository will show my perspective on RObert C. Martin's Clean Code book. I will present and compare a few mistakes I used to do before focusing on writing clean code and how I managed to clean the mess eventually. This repository will be mainly focused on highlighting some brightscrip example, but I will also present some messy code snippets from my old C#/Python projects for a better understanding.
